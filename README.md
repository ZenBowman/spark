spark
=====

Spark is a nonprofit that pairs students from underserved communities with industry mentors over an 8 week period in order to inspire them to stay in school and demonstrate that work-life can be intellectually stimulating.

This repo contains the projects I've worked with Spark kids on over the last few years. The kids used pygame and for the most part created their own art as well to create their own video games.
